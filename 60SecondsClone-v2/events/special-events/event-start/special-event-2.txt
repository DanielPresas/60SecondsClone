The days have been going by too slowly. We're all getting tired of being stuck underground,
 
nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to eat. It's starting to feel like a prison!
 
 
 
Around this time yesterday we heard some knocking on our shelter door. We heard that same
 
knocking again today! Opening the door, we found a young woman seemingly distressed. She told
 
us her twin brother had been captured and put in a nearby bandit camp. She feared she couldn't
 
rescue him alone, and requested our help.
