We were sitting in the bunker, when suddenly, our radio sprung to life! We didn't even think
 
it still worked. Over the radio, we heard what sounded like a prerecorded message on a loop. The
 
message was listing down coordinates and talking about a military presence and a rescue effort.
 
Then, we remembered that our map had coordinates on it! We looked up the coordinates the radio was
 
listing on our map and found out that safety wasn't too far from where we were. We packed our
 
things and started making our way towards the designated spot. We were saved!
