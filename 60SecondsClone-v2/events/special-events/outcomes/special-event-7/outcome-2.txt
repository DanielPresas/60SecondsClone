We decided that in this world, it's kill or be killed. We gathered what we had and opened up
 
the wall. Behind it were the most grotesque-looking mutated rats. Fortunately, they took one look
 
at us and they panicked. We were prepared to fight with them, but I guess we looked too menacing?
 
 
 
We did manage to find some stuff in the wall they were hiding. I don't think they'll forget what
 
happened here today.
