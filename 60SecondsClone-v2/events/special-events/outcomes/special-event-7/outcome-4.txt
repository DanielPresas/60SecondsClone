We decide that we're probably more scared of what's behind the wall than they are of us, so we
 
decided to attack first. We mustered up all the courage inside of us and threw everything
 
we had at them. I don't think we got any of them, but we did scare them away and found some stuff
 
they left in the wall. They seemed to have quite the stash.
