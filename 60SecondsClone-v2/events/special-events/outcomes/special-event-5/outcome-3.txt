Leaving the bunker was risky, but it was a risk we were willing to take to stop that goddamn
 
noise. As we approach the source of the noise, we see it’s a bell, hanging on the bag of a
 
very strange looking fella. He looks dirty and a little bit unstable. He takes one look at us
 
and starts rummaging through his bag. He pulls out a can of soup and a bottle of water, hurls
 
it at us and runs away.
 
 
 
We take the supplies and go back into the bunker, slightly disturbed and confused.
