We're saved! We managed to survive long enough for the military to find us. Thank God we had that
 
radio and that map when we were down there, otherwise we don't think we would have been rescued.
 
 
 
There's always a light at the end of the tunnel, as they say. We've finally reached that light...at
 
least for now.
