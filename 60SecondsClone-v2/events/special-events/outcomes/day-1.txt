We jumped into the bunker, and as the hatch door closed, we heard the explosion of the bomb
 
destroying the world above us. It was loud but muffled due to the thick material, but the vibrations
 
ran through the ground and rattled our bunker.
 
 
 
The destruction of the bomb seemed to last an hour while we feared for the integrity of the bunker
 
and our lives, but eventually the shaking stopped and the noise died down. We got up, organized
 
our supplies and looked around at the gray, featureless walls around us, and came to the conclusion that
 
there probably isn't anyone left out there and this is probably where we will die...
