We decided to follow the map that was printed on the wall. 
 
 
 
It turned out the X on the wall meant "DO NOT GO HERE" rather than "X MARKS THE SPOT". The spot
 
where we ended up was filled with some kind of weird, mutated plant life that spewed weird,
 
green gas from their flowers when they came into contact with someone. 
 
 
 
Long story short, one us didn't feel so good that night.
