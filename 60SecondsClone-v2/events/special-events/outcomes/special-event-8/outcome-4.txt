We decide to investigate the drawing on the wall, and noticed that it's a map that gives
 
directions to a survivors' camp! We follow the route there and as we approach, we see tents set
 
up and people putting their supplies into a pile. A completely undefended pile of supplies...
 
 
 
Maybe they won't notice a few things gone from their supplies. We doubt anyone's taking inventory.
