We decided to bring the suitcase inside. Upon opening it, we discovered it was actually a suitcase
 
in a suitcase. We opened the smaller suitcase and found a single, tasty-looking sandwich.
 
 
 
Unfortunately for us, it turned out this was someone’s method of throwing out their expired
 
food...which one of us found out only after eating the "tasty" sandwich.
