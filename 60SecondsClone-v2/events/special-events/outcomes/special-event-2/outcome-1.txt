We figured we could help a fellow survivor out. One day passed, then two, then three, four,
 
and five until we could no longer keep track. We were starting to think this wasn't such a good
 
idea, until we heard a knocking on our door late at night. 
 
Excited, we went up and opened the door, only to come face to face with the barrel of a shotgun.
 
 
 
...Guess it wasn't such a good idea after all.
