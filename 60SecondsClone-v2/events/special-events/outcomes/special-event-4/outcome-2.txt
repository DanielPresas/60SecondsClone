When we got to the meeting spot, we saw there was a group gathered around a man speaking rather
 
passionately. We pushed our way to the front to see what was happening, and realized that the
 
man was actually a bandit leader! He seemed to be handing out weapons to anybody willing to
 
join him. Taking a weapon, we were given a slip of paper and told we would be contacted soon.
 
Oh well, at least something good came out of a seemingly bad decision.
