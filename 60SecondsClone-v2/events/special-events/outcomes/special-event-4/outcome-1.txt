We decided that meeting other survivors wasn't such a bad idea. We were getting sick of each
 
other anyways...
 
 
 
When we arrived at the meeting spot, we were shocked to find out that there were so many
 
survivors! After waiting a few minutes, we saw a man in a long dark coat begin gathering people
 
around him. Once everyone was gathered, the man began talking of creating a safe haven among us.
 
He said it would take a short amount of time given the number of people in the area. We
 
couldn't be more excited! After the man's short speech everyone was given a piece of paper and
 
told we would meet soon.
