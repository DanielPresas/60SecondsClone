We decided that meeting other survivors wasn't such a bad idea. Upon arriving at the marked
 
location, we saw a line of people in front of a mountain of supplies. We could see a man
 
surrounded by mercenaries distributing boxes. We got into line, slowly making our way to 
 
the front.
 
 
 
Once we got there, we were given a box filled with food! So much food! This expedition was
 
definitely worth it.
