We heard a knock at the bunker door today. We opened it to see what it was, and saw a slightly
 
disheveled man dressed in a heavy robe. He screamed, "I am Ahriman, and I have come for your
 
souls!" He then dramatically reached into his robes and screamed, "Fear me mortals!" as he pulled
 
some figurines out of his robe and threw them at us.
 
 
 
Before we could recover from our confusion, he ran away, screaming something about "not being
 
at his full power level". We decided to leave the figurines at the bunker door because we aren't
 
sure if they're dangerous or not.
