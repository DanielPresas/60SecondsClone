We've been scratching the days we've been stuck in this bunker on the wall so we can keep track of how
 
long we have been stuck in this box. So far, We've learned that we can't trust it because we've counted
 
one day twice, at least once...
 
 
 
It also doesn't help that none of us ever see the sun or have any sense of time down here.
